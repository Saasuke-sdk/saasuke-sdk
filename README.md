# Saasuke SDK

Welcome to the **Saasuke SDK**! This SDK simplifies blockchain game development on Starknet, providing everything you need to build, deploy, and scale interactive on-chain games. With TypeScript-to-Cairo conversion, reusable modules, and smart contract templates, developers can streamline their projects and focus on creating immersive gaming experiences.

## Features
- **TypeScript to Cairo Conversion**: Write game logic in TypeScript, auto-generate and deploy Cairo contracts.
- **Smart Contract Templates**: Pre-built smart contracts for faster development.
- **Scalable Physics Engine**: Implement game physics with features like collision detection and gravity.
- **Turn-Based Mechanics**: Simplify turn-based logic for multiplayer games.
- **AI NPC Behavior**: Templates for integrating AI-driven NPCs into your game.
